        catalog is a curated list of student competitions, olympiads and scholarships, each
        with real dates and a link to the organizer&apos;s own site. It is not a submission
        portal or an application tracker - StudyMap never handles entries or applications on
        your behalf. Every record links out to the official competition site for the actual
        submission.

            Search by name or subject in the search box, or tap a category chip
            (STEM, Coding, Essay Writing, and so on) to narrow the list. Open the
            filter panel for more: format (online, offline, hybrid), individual or
            team participation, region, free entry only, an age range, and a
            deadline window (next 30 or 90 days, or this cycle).

            Use the list/grid toggle above the results to switch between a dense
            list and a card grid - your choice is remembered on this device.

            Each competition&apos;s detail page shows its full timeline -
            registration open/close, submission deadlines, judging rounds,
            results, ceremony - and a live countdown to the next one. A date
            tagged <span className="font-medium">estimated</span> is the
            organizer&apos;s best guess for this cycle, not yet confirmed; treat it
            as a planning date, not a hard deadline, until it&apos;s updated.

          <p>
            Some competitions run a country-specific qualifying stage before the
            international round - a national olympiad round that feeds into an
            international one, for example. Where a real pathway exists, the
            detail page&apos;s{" "}
            <span className="font-medium">Country pathways</span> section lists
            its stages with dates and a link to that country&apos;s official
            page. Pick your country from the tabs to see the stages that apply
            to you specifically, not just the international dates.

            competition also shows how many people have saved it, but only once
            that count reaches a few - a count of one or two would just identify
            individual savers, so it stays hidden until then.

          defaults to your saved competitions once you have at least one, with a
          toggle to see everything instead. If you have no saves yet - signed in

          URL) or Apple Calendar (File &gt; New Calendar Subscription). Every saved
          competition&apos;s dates then show up there automatically, kept in sync
          each time your calendar app refreshes the feed. Dates still marked{" "}

          The link is a bearer credential, like a password - anyone who has it can
          see your saved competitions, so treat it like one. The Saved page has a
          button to get a new link at any time, which immediately stops the old one
          from working.
