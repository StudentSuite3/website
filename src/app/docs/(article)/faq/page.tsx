              Every place was added by a contributor through GitHub, with a required
              4.0+ Google Maps rating and 50+ reviews at the time of submission - but
              that proof lives in the pull request, not as an automated check, so it&apos;s
              honor-system rather than machine-verified. Places can also go stale
              (closed, moved, hours changed) after being added. See{" "}

          <CalloutCard title="Do I need an account to use StudyMap?">
            <p>
              No. The map, search, filters, and exam calendar all work fully without
              signing in. An account is only needed for two optional, private features:
              saving your own places and a home location, and adding personal events to
              the calendar - neither of which are visible to anyone else.
            </p>
          </CalloutCard>

          <CalloutCard title="How do I sign in?">
            <p>
              Go to{" "}
              <a href="https://studyymap.com/login" className="font-medium text-primary hover:underline">
                Sign in
              </a>{" "}
              and use either Google or email and password. There&apos;s nothing else to
              configure.
            </p>
          </CalloutCard>

          <CalloutCard title="What's the difference between adding a place and saving one?">
            <p>
              Adding a place (via GitHub PR or issue) puts it on the public map for every
              visitor, after the quality gate above. Saving a place (via the map&apos;s
              &quot;My places&quot; panel, signed in) is private to your account only and
              never appears on anyone else&apos;s map - it&apos;s a personal bookmark, not
              a public contribution.
            </p>
